# SDC Projects Collection

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ This repo is a collection of 16 different web and software projects built during my Software Development Course. Each folder is a separate projectâ€”some are simple web pages, others are full apps with backend code.

## What's Inside?
- Frontend projects (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Node.js and Java backend demos
- Django web apps
- APIs, authentication, and more

## How to Explore
1. **Browse the folders**: Each `PROJECT-XX` folder is a standalone project.
2. **Read the local README**: Most projects have their own `readme_532.md` or similar file with details.
3. **Run or open**: For web projects, open `index.html` in your browser. For Node.js/Django/Java, see the project README for setup.

## Why?
This repo is a showcase of my learning journeyâ€”feel free to explore, use, or get inspired!
