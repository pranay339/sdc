This is a browser-based To-Do List app that allows users to add tasks with a due date and time.
The app stores tasks in the browser's localStorage so they persist even after refreshing.
It prompts or uses a default user name and shows a welcome message (Welcome, Pranavika!).
Users can change their name using the "Change User" button.
Each task can be clicked to mark as completed (with strike-through and removal).
Tasks are automatically styled as "overdue" (red) or "today" (yellow).
The app checks every 30 seconds for upcoming tasks and shows a browser notification.
It also plays a sound alert when a task is about to be due.
Tasks overdue by more than 60 seconds are auto-removed from the list.
The UI is styled using CSS for a clean, modern look with responsive layout.
